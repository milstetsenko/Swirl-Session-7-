#creating a storage vector of 20 NA values
store1<-rep(NA, 20)
# Next, let's create a for loop that calculates the value i^2 + 2i + 4, where i is the index of the storage vector. We will save the result to the 
#storage vector we just created. Copy and paste the following code but also try to understand what it's doing:
for (i in 1:length(store1)){store1[i]  <- i^2 + 2*i + 4}

#Recall the simulation we ran from a few sessions ago. A simulation is already ran when you started this lesson, generating 100 simulated
#coefficients. The linear model is re78 ~ age, based on the lalonde dataset. Let's first take a look at the simulated coefficients, using

lm1<- lm(re78~age, data = lalonde)
lm1
sim_results<- sim (lm1)
sim_results@coef

#Each row represents a simulation, with an intercept and coefficients for the variable age. To select specific values from the simulated, we can use
#| the indexing, sim_results@coef[x, y], where x is the row and y is the column. For example, if we want the age coefficient for the 5th simulation, we
#| would type sim_results@coef[5, 2].
sim_results@coef[5, 2]

#Write code that calculates the average of the simulated coefficients on age (the second column).
mean(sim_results@coef[,2])
